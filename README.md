  *********************

  Running LifeFLOW

  LifeFLOW runs with HTML, JavaScript, PHP, on Apache. It mostly operates in the player's browser, with frequent AJAX interaction to the server.

  You can see the current version of LifeFLOW at the official website:

  Developing LifeFLOW

  You can develop LifeFLOW on any system with a web server and PHP. Most Linux distributions include these, or on Windows you can download and install XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/).

  Simply place the program files in a directory within your web server tree, and browse to that location with your favorite web browser! :)

  If under a particular environment the page doesn't load, specify the actual index page with an area, for example yourdomain.com/lifeflow/index.php?area=Area-05

  For any other questions, please contact us! :)
